# App

(Contains a `tkinter.Tk` object)

`__init__(self, title="guizero", width=500, height=500, layout="auto", bgcolor=None, bg=None, visible=True)`

### What is it?
The `App` object is the basis of all GUIs created using guizero. It is the main window which contains all of the other widgets.

### How do I make one?

Create an `App` object like this:

```python
from guizero import App
app = App()
app.display()
```

### Starting parameters

When you create an `App` object you can specify any of the following parameters, all of which are optional. Specify parameters in the brackets like this: `app = App(bg="red", height=200)`

| Parameter | Data type          | Default   | Compulsory | Description                                                                                      |
|-----------|--------------------|-----------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| bg        | [color](colors.md) | None      | No         | The background colour of the app window and widgets inside it. Takes a [color](colors.md) value. |
| height    | int                | 500       | No         | The height of the window in pixels.                                                              |
| layout    | string             | "auto"    | No         | Whether widgets pack themselves (`"auto"`) or you specify their position on a grid (`"grid"`)    |
| title     | string             | "guizero" | No         | The title displayed in the bar at the top of the window.                                         |
| width     | int                | 500       | No         | The width of the window in pixels.                                                               |
| visible   | boolean            | True      | No         | If the App should be visible.                                                                    |
| _bgcolor_ | _string_           | _None_    | _No_       | _Replaced by `bg` parameter_                                                                     |

Parameters in _italics_ will still work but are **deprecated** - this means you should stop using them because they may not work in future versions of guizero

### Methods

You can call the following methods on an `App` object.

### Properties

You can set and get the following properties:

| Method     | Data type          | Description                                               |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| bg         | [color](colors.md) | The background colour of the window                       |
| enabled    | boolean            | `True` if the app is enabled                              |
| height     | int                | The height of the window                                  |
| font       | string             | The font that widgets should use                          |
| full_screen   | boolean            | False      | No         | Whether the App is full screen        |
| layout     | string             | The layout being used by the App (`"auto"`) or (`"grid"`) |
| title      | string             | The title of the window                                   |
| text_size  | int                | The size of the text widgets should use                   |
| text_color | [color](colors.md) | The colour of the text widgets should use                 |
| visible    | boolean            | If the app is visible                                     |
| width      | int                | The width of the window                                   |


Refer to a property as `<name of widget>.property`. For example, if your `App` object is called `app` you would write `app.title`.

You can **set** the property (for example `app.title = "Hello world"`) or **get** the value of the property to use (for example `print(app.title)`).

### Examples

**Creating an App object**

Create an `App` object by calling the `App()` constructor. You should give the object a name so you can refer to it later - in this case we have called it `app`. It is best to keep the name you give to your `App` object quite short, as you will have to use it to tell other widgets where they should be stored.

At the end of the program you **MUST** tell the app object to begin the display loop.

```python
from guizero import App
app = App(title="My app", height=300, width=200)
app.display()
```

**Changing the title**

You can change the title of the app object once it has been created like this:

```python
from guizero import App
app = App(title="My app", height=300, width=200)
app.title = "A different title"
app.display()
```
This will display the app with the updated title:
