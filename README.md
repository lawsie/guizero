* Abstracts away details new learners find difficult to understand (such as Tkinter StringVar() objects)
* Accessible widget naming system to help new learners to build up a mental model
* Flexible enough to be used for projects up to A-Level standard, yet accessible to primary school children
* Comprehensive and accessible documentation with examples
* Generates helpful additional error messages
