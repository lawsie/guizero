Using pop-ups Pop-ups can be called from an App or Window object, for example: app.info(\"info\", \"this is a guizero app\") Pop-ups can also be imported individually at the start of your program, for example: from guizero import info info(\"info\", \"this is a guizero app\") Purpose These functions pop up a box on the screen that displays a message or asks a question. The functions available are: warn(title, text) - popup box with a warning icon info(title, text) - popup box with an information icon error(title, text) - popup box with an error icon yesno(title, text) - popup box with yes and no options. Pressing Yes returns True and pressing No returns False . question(title, text, initial_value=None) - popup box with a question box which can accept a text response. Pressing Ok returns value entered into the box is returned and pressing Cancel returns None . select_file(title=\"Select file\", folder=\".\", filetypes=[[\"All files\", \"*.*\"]], save=False, filename=\"\") - popup file dialog box which asks the user to select a file. By default, an Open button is displayed, setting save to True will change the button to Save as . The path of the selected file is returned by the function. A filename parameter can be supplied which will auto populate the file name field. select_folder(title=\"Select folder\", folder=\".\") - popup box which asks the user to select a folder. The path of the selected folder is returned by the function. select_color(color=None) - popup box which prompts the user to select a color. Set color to an #rrggbb to select a default color when the popup opens. Pressing Ok returns the select color as a #rrggbb value, pressing Cancel returns None . All pop up boxes use the native display, so they will look different depending on your operating system. Examples Warning box This will pop up a warning box with the title \"Uh oh!\" and the message \"You are almost out of biscuits!\" . from guizero import App app = App(title=\"Biscuit monitor\") app.warn(\"Uh oh!\", \"You are almost out of biscuits!\") app.display() On Windows, the box looks like this: The info and error boxes work in exactly the same way but will display different icons. Yes/No box When this function is called it returns a boolean value. If Yes was pressed, return True If No was pressed, return False You can store this value in a variable and test it: from guizero import App app = App(title=\"Snowman\") build_a_snowman = app.yesno(\"A question...\", \"Do you want to build a snowman?\") if build_a_snowman == True: app.info(\"Snowman\", \"It doesn't have to be a snowman\") else: app.error(\"Snowman\", \"Okay bye...\") app.display() This code will first display the yes/no box If Yes is pressed, an information box will be displayed: If No is pressed, an error box will be displayed Example: Using an alert as a callback You can also use these functions in a callback (when you have to provide a function for another widget to call). Here is an example with a PushButton which pops up an info box when it is pressed. from guizero import App, PushButton, info app = App() button = PushButton(app, command=app.info, args=[\"Info\", \"You pressed the button\"]) app.display() The arguments provided to the PushButton are: Where the button should be created (within the app ) The name of the function to call when pressed ( info ) A list of the arguments to the function you are calling (values for the title and message arguments for the info function) Example: Do you really want to close?

This is because guizero (in common with almost all GUIs) operates an event driven model of programming which may be different to the one you are familiar with. Your first guizero program might look a bit like this: from guizero import App app = App(\"Hello world\") app.display() The line of code app.display() doesn't just display the app - it enters an infinite event loop which is watching and waiting for events to happen on the GUI. Events include things like the user clicking on a button, moving a slider, typing in a text box etc. No code written after this line will ever execute because the event loop is infinite. Example Suppose you want a counter on your GUI to start counting up by 1 every second. You might be tempted to write a program like this: from guizero import App, Text from time import sleep app = App(\"Hello world\") text = Text(app, text=\"1\") while True: text.value = int(text.value) + 1 sleep(1) app.display() If you run this program, you'll see that this does not have the desired effect - your program crashes! This is because you have blocked the updating of your GUI in two ways: The sleep() command - whilst your program is sleeping, the GUI will not update and you will not be able to click on anything. The while loop - once you enter this loop, your GUI will never update ever again and will probably crash. Solution This behaviour is not a bug within guizero or tkinter. You must write GUI based programs in a different way to the one you may be used to. If you want to repeatedly perform an action you would do it like this: Write a function which performs the desired action (in this example counter() ) Set a callback to that function.

The .children property returns the list of RadioButton widgets in the order they appear in the ButtonGroup : To access the internal RadioButton tk object you would use the child's tk property e.g. button_group = ButtonGroup(app) for radio_button in ButtonGroup.children: tk_radio_button = radio_button.tk","title":"Using ButtonGroup tk widgets"},{"location":"changelog/","text":"guizero 1.2.0 - 2021-05-04 Added filename to select_file dialog Added when_resized and when_double_clicked events Removed previously deprecated App.on_closed method A window icon can be set using the .icon property Add select_color popup Documentation updates and fixes Added new examples and recipes Tests updated to cope with a greater range of operating systems.

I am extremely grateful to the following people who have contributed pull requests since the last version: bcroston , bennuttall , Coal0 , martinohanlon and scotty3785 I am also very pleased to announce that martinohanlon has very kindly agreed to maintain guizero whilst I am on maternity leave, beginning December 2017. General changes: All classes rewritten with internal Tk objects rather than extending the Tk object, meaning you can access all Tk functionality as Object.tk.tkmethod() (Credit for idea: bennuttall ) Improved use of library with tab complete editors (e.g. ipython) \u2013 only the guizero properties and methods are listed so the list is shorter and more friendly. (Credit for idea: bennuttall ) [Bug fix] Grid layout now lays items out properly. Previously the x and y axes were flipped. (Whoops!) This fix will cause apps with a grid layout to look different, but now behave correctly. You may need to update old code as a result of this change. All classes now inherit from mixins, adding 9 new common methods usable on most widgets - after() , cancel() , destroy() , disable() , enable() , focus() , hide() , show() , repeat() , (Credit: Coal0 and martinohanlon ) The new repeat() method allows you to easily specify a repeated callback to a function, making it extremely easy to perform repetitive actions such as updating the GUI based on readings from a sensor. Documentation and examples have been improved and updated App: New constructor argument bg replaces deprecated bgcolor argument. If both are specified, bg overrides bgcolor . set_title() and bgcolor() methods are now deprecated and have been replaced by title and bg properties New additional properties width and height ButtonGroup: get() and set() methods are now deprecated and have been replaced by the value property New value_text property to get the text associated with the selected option CheckBox: get_text() , get_value() and change_text() methods are now deprecated and have been replaced by the value and text properties New toggle() method added Combo: get() and set() methods are now deprecated and have been replaced by the value property [Bug fix] set_default() now correctly resets the combo back to its originally specified value, whether this was the first option or a specified option Picture: set() method is now deprecated and has been replaced by the value property PushButton: set_text() method is now deprecated and has been replaced by the text property New properties for text_color , bg , font , text_size , height and width \u2013 make your buttons look pretty! Find out whether a button is pressed (1) or released (0) with the new value property New icon() method to set the icon of a button after it is created toggle_state() method deprecated and renamed to toggle() for consistency Slider: New value property for getting and setting the value of the slider Text: New constructor arguments text_color and bg color constructor argument now deprecated and replaced by text_color . If both are specified, text_color overrides color . get() , set() , color() , font_face() and font_size() methods are now deprecated, replaced by properties value , text_color , bg , font and size TextBox: get() and set() methods now deprecated and replaced by value property Waffle: All waffles will now have a memory. The remember constructor argument remains for backwards compatibility only and will be removed in a future release . You can now click on a Waffle, and specify a command to run when the Waffle is clicked on. The function given as the command should take two arguments as it will be passed the x, y coordinates of the pixel that was clicked.

The CheckBox object displays a check box to allow an option to be ticked or un-ticked. How do I make one? Create a CheckBox object like this: from guizero import App, CheckBox app = App() checkbox = CheckBox(app, text=\"Add extra glitter\") app.display() Starting parameters When you create a CheckBox object you must specify master and text and you can specify any of the optional parameters. Specify parameters in the brackets, like this: checkbox = CheckBox(app, text=\"Add extra glitter\") Parameter Takes Default Compulsory Description master App, Window or Box - Yes The container to which this widget belongs text string \"\" No The text to display next to the check box align string None - Alignment of this widget within its container. Possible values: \"top\" , \"bottom\" , \"left\" , \"right\" . command function name None - The name of a function to call when this checkbox is ticked/unticked args list None - If you wish to pass any arguments to the function specified in the command parameter, you can specify them as a list grid List [int, int] None - [x,y] coordinates of this widget. This parameter is only required if the master object has a grid layout. visible boolean True No If the widget should be visible. enabled boolean None No If the widget should be enabled. If None (the default) the enabled property will be inherited from the master width size None No Set the width of the widget in characters or to \"fill\" height size None No Set the height of the widget in characters or to \"fill\" Methods You can call the following methods on a CheckBox object. Method Takes Returns Description after(time, command, args=None) time (int), command (function name), args (list of arguments) - Schedules a single call to command after time milliseconds. (To repeatedly call the same command, use repeat() ) cancel(command) command (function name) - Cancels a scheduled call to command destroy() - - Destroys the widget disable() - - Disables the widget so that it is \"greyed out\" and cannot be interacted with enable() - - Enables the widget focus() - - Gives focus to the widget hide() - - Hides the widget from view. This method will unpack the widget from the layout manager. repeat(time, command, args=None) time (int), command (function name), args (list of arguments) - Repeats command every time milliseconds. This is useful for scheduling a function to be regularly called, for example updating a value read from a sensor. resize(width, height) width (int), height (int) - Sets the width and height of the widget show() - - Displays the widget if it was previously hidden toggle() - - Switches the CheckBox to the opposite of its current value. i.e. if it is ticked, untick it and vice versa update_command(command, args =None) command (function name), args ( Optional List of arguments to be passed to command) - Updates the function to call when the checkbox is ticked/unticked Properties You can set and get the following properties: Method Data type Description align string The alignment of this widget within its container bg color The background colour of the widget enabled boolean True if the widget is enabled font string The font of the text grid List [x,y] coordinates of this widget.

Widgets can be arranged into \"containers\" (e.g. App , Window , Box ) using either of these layouts: auto - where widgets are positioned automatically grid - you specify where in a grid each widget should be positioned The layout is set using the layout parameter of the container, for example: app = App(layout=\"auto\") app = App(layout=\"grid\") If no layout parameter is specified, the default auto layout is used. Auto layout auto is the default layout used when a container is created. All widgets will be arranged in the order they are created and aligned to the centre. For example, the following code will create two Text widgets, one on top of the other. from guizero import App, Text app = App() text_1 = Text(app, text=\"on top\") text_2 = Text(app, text=\"below\") app.display() Aligning Widgets can be aligned to either the top , bottom , left or right , using the align property when created. Aligning a widget will cause it to be \"stuck\" to that side of the container, for example: from guizero import App, Text app = App() top_text = Text(app, text=\"at the top\", align=\"top\") bottom_text = Text(app, text=\"at the bottom\", align=\"bottom\") left_text = Text(app, text=\"to the left\", align=\"left\") right_text = Text(app, text=\"to the right\", align=\"right\") app.display() By aligning multiple widgets to the same side of the container, widgets can be made to stack together: from guizero import App, Text, TextBox, PushButton app = App() text = Text(app, text=\"label\", align=\"left\") text_box = TextBox(app, text=\"enter text\", align=\"left\") button = PushButton(app, text=\"submit\", align=\"left\") app.display() The widgets will stack in the order they are created, so the widget created first will be closest to the edge in the direction specified. Filling Widgets can also be made to \"fill\" all available space by setting the width and height parameters to fill . Here are some examples: A TextBox could span the entire width of the container: from guizero import App, TextBox app = App() text_box = TextBox(app, text=\"enter text\", width=\"fill\") app.display() Or a ListBox could fill the left hand side by using fill for the height and align to the left : from guizero import App, ListBox app = App() list_box = ListBox(app, items=[\"a list\"], height=\"fill\", align=\"left\") app.display() Using fill for the width and the height will make a widget use all of the available space: from guizero import App, PushButton app = App() button = PushButton(app, width=\"fill\", height=\"fill\") app.display() When multiple widgets use fill , the Window Manager (operating system) will distribute the space accordingly between all the widgets which have requested to fill it. from guizero import App, ListBox, PushButton app = App() list_box = ListBox(app, items=[\"a list\", \"of items\", \"yay\"], height=\"fill\", align=\"left\") button = PushButton(app, width=\"fill\", height=\"fill\", align=\"right\") app.display() Note : Using fill may not always have the effect you are expecting, as it is up to the operating system to distribute screen space. Grid layout The grid layout allows you to position widgets into a virtual grid. When you create a widget you will need to pass an extra parameter called grid which is a list containing [x,y] coordinates for where you want the widget to appear, like this: app = App(layout=\"grid\") text = Text(app, text=\"Hello world\", grid=[0,1]) There is no need to specify the width or height of the grid you want - it will expand depending on the coordinates you provide with each widget. However, grid cells containing no objects will have no height or width. This is really useful when creating GUIs where you want widgets to line up. For example, you could create a number keypad: from guizero import App, PushButton app = App(layout=\"grid\") button1 = PushButton(app, text=\"1\", grid=[0,0]) button2 = PushButton(app, text=\"2\", grid=[1,0]) button3 = PushButton(app, text=\"3\", grid=[2,0]) button4 = PushButton(app, text=\"4\", grid=[0,1]) button5 = PushButton(app, text=\"5\", grid=[1,1]) button6 = PushButton(app, text=\"6\", grid=[2,1]) button7 = PushButton(app, text=\"7\", grid=[0,2]) button8 = PushButton(app, text=\"8\", grid=[1,2]) button9 = PushButton(app, text=\"9\", grid=[2,2]) button0 = PushButton(app, text=\"0\", grid=[1,3]) app.display() You can also align widgets within the grid, which is useful when you are creating a form: from guizero import App, Text, TextBox app = App(layout=\"grid\") name_label = Text(app, text=\"Name\", grid=[0,0], align=\"left\") name = TextBox(app, grid=[1,0]) surname_label = Text(app, text=\"Surname\", grid=[0,1], align=\"left\") surname = TextBox(app, grid=[1,1]) dob_label = Text(app, text=\"Date of Birth\", grid=[0,2], align=\"left\") dob = TextBox(app, grid=[1,2]) app.display() Spanning columns or rows Widgets can be made to span multiple columns or rows by specifying the span within the grid parameter. These are optional, but if specified both must be included using the format [x,y,xspan,yspan] . The example below shows a Text widget located at 0,1 and spanning two columns (x) and one row (y): text = Text(app, text=\"Hello world\", grid=[0,1,2,1]) This layout method can be used to include widgets of different sizes arranged alongside each other. from guizero import App, Picture app = App(layout=\"grid\") picture1 = Picture(app, image=\"std1.gif\", grid=[0,0]) picture2 = Picture(app, image=\"std2.gif\", grid=[1,0]) picture3 = Picture(app, image=\"tall1.gif\", grid=[2,0,1,2]) picture4 = Picture(app, image=\"wide1.gif\", grid=[0,1,2,1]) app.display() Boxes By using a Box widget you can segment your GUI into different sections allowing you to lay out your user interface in any way you want. ( Code for example above ) If you wanted to create a title in the top left hand corner of your GUI, you could use a Box which fills the top of the App and put a Text widget inside aligned to the left . from guizero import App, Box, Text app = App() title_box = Box(app, width=\"fill\", align=\"top\") title = Text(title_box, text=\"title\", align=\"left\") app.display() You may find it easier to design your layout if your Boxes have borders, which can be done by setting the border parameter on Box to True . title_box = Box(app, width=\"fill\", align=\"top\", border=True) A similar method can be used to put \"OK\" and \"Cancel\" buttons at the bottom right of the GUI. Remember that the widgets will get stacked on the right in order of creation, so the cancel button is created first. from guizero import App, Box, PushButton app = App() buttons_box = Box(app, width=\"fill\", align=\"bottom\") cancel = PushButton(buttons_box, text=\"Cancel\", align=\"right\") ok = PushButton(buttons_box, text=\"OK\", align=\"right\") app.display() Note : You can put a Box inside another Box , allowing you to layer boxes and position your widgets. Tip : When creating a GUI you may find it easier to design it first on paper, noting where your boxes will be positioned. Unfortunately, whilst you can put one box inside another box, guizero does not support mailing it to yourself, nor smashing it with a hammer ;)","title":"Layouts"},{"location":"layout/#layouts","text":"The layout of your GUI is how you arrange the widgets in the window.

Remember that the widgets will get stacked on the right in order of creation, so the cancel button is created first. from guizero import App, Box, PushButton app = App() buttons_box = Box(app, width=\"fill\", align=\"bottom\") cancel = PushButton(buttons_box, text=\"Cancel\", align=\"right\") ok = PushButton(buttons_box, text=\"OK\", align=\"right\") app.display() Note : You can put a Box inside another Box , allowing you to layer boxes and position your widgets.

They are the things which appear on the GUI, everything from the app itself to text boxes, buttons and pictures. At the start of every guizero program, choose the widgets you need from the guizero library and import them e.g. from guizero import App, Text, PushButton, Slider You only need to import each widget once, and then you can use it in your program as many times as you like. The App widget Every guizero app will need an App widget. This is the main window. At the end of every guizero program you must tell the program to display the app you have just created. from guizero import App app = App(title=\"My guizero app\") app.display() Adding widgets All the text boxes, buttons, sliders and even plain old pieces of text which appear on your GUI are widgets. All widgets go between the line of code to create the App and the app.display() line. from guizero import App, Text, TextBox app = App(title=\"Whats your name?\") # create widgets here message = Text(app, text=\"Enter your name\") name = TextBox(app) app.display() Let\u2019s look at the Text widget code in a bit more detail: message = Text(app, text=\"Enter your name\")) message = - The Text object has a name, just like any variable Text - an object which creates a piece of text on the screen app \u2013 This tells the Text where it will live. Most of the time your widgets will live directly inside the app. text=\"Enter your name\" - The text to display Have a look at Widget overview to see all the widgets, find out more about them and how they are used. Using events An event is how you trigger code as a result of users interacting with your app. An example of an event could be a user clicking on a button or entering text into a TextBox. When an event occurs you can run a piece of code. This is how you make your app \"do stuff\". Widgets which can be interacted with can accept a command parameter. You can set the command parameter to be the name of a function which will be called when the widget is used. In this example the function say_hello is called when a PushButton is pressed. from guizero import App, PushButton, Text def say_hello(): message.value = \"Hello\" app = App() message = Text(app) button = PushButton(app, text=\"Press me\", command=say_hello) app.display() In this example the command parameter of a TextBox widget is used to call the count function which displays how many characters have been entered. from guizero import App, TextBox, Text def count(): character_count.value = len(entered_text.value) app = App() entered_text = TextBox(app, command=count) character_count = Text(app) app.display() Controlling widgets The status of a widget can be controlled. This allows you to control how an app is used e.g. Only allowing the submit button of a form to be used when all the data has been entered You can control whether a widget is: shown hidden enabled disabled A widget will only appear on an app if it is visible. The widget can only be interacted with (used) if it is enabled. In this example PushButton widgets are used to change the status of a TextBox widget by calling the text box's show , hide , disable and enable methods. from guizero import App, PushButton, TextBox def show(): text_box.show() def hide(): text_box.hide() def enable(): text_box.enable() def disable(): text_box.disable() app = App() text_box = TextBox(app) show_button = PushButton(app, text=\"show\", command=show) hide_button = PushButton(app, text=\"hide\", command=hide) enable_button = PushButton(app, text=\"enable\", command=enable) disable_button = PushButton(app, text=\"disable\",command=disable) app.display() Destroying widgets Widgets can be destroyed (removed) from an application by using the destroy method.

Possible values: \"top\" , \"bottom\" , \"left\" , \"right\" . color color \"white\" - The default colour of pixels on the waffle command function name None - The name of a function to call when the waffle is clicked. This function MUST take either zero or two arguments, if the function takes two arguments the x and y co-ordinates of the pixel which was clicked will be given. dim int 20 - How large one of the pixels on the waffle is dotty boolean False - Whether the pixels display as dots/circles (True) or squares (False) grid List [int, int] None - [x,y] coordinates of this widget. This parameter is only required if the master object has a grid layout. height int 3 - Set the height in waffle pixels pad int 5 - How much space is between the pixels on the waffle width int 3 - Set the width in waffle pixels visible boolean True No If the widget should be visible. enabled boolean None No If the widget should be enabled. If None (the default) the enabled property will be inherited from the master bg color None No The background colour of the waffle. Takes a color value. Methods You can call the following methods on your Waffle object.
