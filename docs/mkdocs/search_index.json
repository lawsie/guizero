The default layout is \nauto\n.\n\n\nIf you choose the \ngrid\n layout, this means that when you create a widget you will need to pass the widget an extra parameter called \ngrid\n which is a list containing \n[x,y]\n coordinates for where you want the widget to appear within the app, like this:\n\n\ntext = Text(app, text=\"Hello world\", grid=[0,1])\n\n\n\n\nThere is no need to specify the width or height of the grid you want - it will expand depending on the coordinates you provide with each widget.
